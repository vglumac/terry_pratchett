        series: "Science novels",
        short: "When a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands... our universe.",
        synopsis: `When a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands: Roundworld, where neither magic nor common sense seems to stand a chance against logic.<br>
        The Universe, of course, is our own. And Roundworld is Earth. As the wizards watch their accidental creation grow, we follow the story of our universe from the primal singularity of the Big Bang to the internet and beyond.<br>
        Through this original Terry Pratchett story (with intervening chapters from Cohen and Stewart), we discover how puny and insignificant individual lives are against a cosmic backdrop of creation and disaster. Yet, paradoxically, we see how the richness of a universe based on rules, has led to a complex world and at least one species that tried to get a grip of what was going on.<br>
        The fantastic first book in the Sunday Times bestselling Science of Discworld series.`,

        synopsis: `In The Science of Discworld II, our authors join forces again to see just what happens when the wizards meddle with history in a battle against the elves for the future of humanity on Earth. London is replaced by a dozy Neanderthal village. The Renaissance is given a push. The role of fat women in art is developed. And one very famous playwright gets born and writes The Play. Weaving together a fast-paced Discworld novelette with cutting-edge scientific commentary on the evolution and development of the human mind, culture, language, art, and science, this is a book in which &lsquo;the hard science is as gripping as the fiction&rsquo;.`,

        series: "Science novels",
        short: "Roundworld is in trouble again, and this time it looks fatal...",
        synopsis: `Roundworld is in trouble again, and this time it looks fatal. Having created it in the first place, the wizards of Unseen University feel vaguely responsible for its safety. They know the creatures who lived there escaped the impending Big Freeze by inventing the space elevator &ndash; they even intervened to rid the planet of a plague of elves, who attempted to divert humanity onto a different time track. But now it&rsquo;s all gone wrong &ndash; Victorian England has stagnated and the pace of progress would embarrass a limping snail. Unless something drastic is done, there won&rsquo;t be time for anyone to invent spaceflight and the human race will be turned into ice-pops.<br>
        Why, though, did history come adrift? Was it Sir Arthur Nightingale&rsquo;s dismal book about natural selection? Or was it the devastating response by an obscure country vicar called Charles Darwin, whose bestselling Theology of Species made it impossible to refute the divine design of living creatures? Either way, it&rsquo;s no easy task to change history, as the wizards discover to their cost. Can the God of Evolution come to humanity&rsquo;s aid and ensure Darwin writes a very different book? And who stopped him writing it in the first place?`,

        synopsis: `The fourth book in the Science of Discworld series, and this time around dealing with THE REALLY BIG QUESTIONS, Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s brilliant new Discworld story Judgement Day is annotated with very big footnotes (the interleaving chapters) by mathematician Ian Stewart and biologist Jack Cohen, to bring you a mind-mangling combination of fiction, cutting-edge science and philosophy.<br>
        Marjorie Daw is a librarian, and takes her job &ndash; and indeed the truth of words &ndash; very seriously. She doesn&rsquo;t know it, but her world and ours &ndash; Roundworld &ndash; is in big trouble. On Discworld, a colossal row is brewing&#8230;<br>
        The Wizards of Unseen University feel responsible for Roundworld (as one would for a pet gerbil). After all, they brought it into existence by bungling an experiment in Quantum ThaumoDynamics. But legal action is being brought against them by Omnians, who say that the Wizards&rsquo; god-like actions make a mockery of their noble religion.<br>
        As the finest legal brains in Discworld (a zombie and a priest) gird their loins to do battle &ndash; and when the Great Big Thing in the High Energy Magic Laboratory is switched on &ndash; Marjorie Daw finds herself thrown across the multiverse and right in the middle of the whole explosive affair.<br>
        As God, the Universe and, frankly, Everything Else is investigated by the trio, you can expect world-bearing elephants, quantum gravity in the Escher-verse, evolutionary design, eternal inflation, dark matter, disbelief systems &ndash; and an in-depth study of how to invent a better mousetrap.`,

        An eighth son of an eighth son is born, a wizard squared, a source of magic. A sourcerer.<br>
        Unseen University, the Discworld&rsquo;s most magical establishment, has finally got its wish: the emergence of a wizard more powerful than ever before. You&rsquo;d think they would have been a little more careful what they wished for . . .<br>

        synopsis: `Eric calls up a demon to grant him three wishes &ndash; but what he gets is the Discworld&rsquo;s most incompetent wizard&#8230;<br>
        Eric is the Discworld&rsquo;s only demonology hacker. The trouble is, he&rsquo;s not very good at it. All he wants is the usual three wishes: to be immortal, rule the world and have the most beautiful woman fall madly in love with him. The usual stuff.<br>

        This is the worst thing you can wish on a citizen of Discworld. Especially for the magically challenged Rincewind, who has already had far too much excitement in his life.<br>
        Unfortunately, the unlucky wizard always seems to end up in the middle of, well, absolutely everything. So when a request for a &lsquo;Great Wizzard&rsquo; arrives from the faraway Counterweight Continent, it&rsquo;s obviously Rincewind who&rsquo;s sent. For one thing, he&rsquo;s the only one who spells wizard that way.<br>

A sword is a thing,&rsquo; &ndash; he drew his own sword; it made an almost silken sound &ndash; &lsquo;and of course you can&rsquo;t blame a sword if someone thrust it at you, sir.&rsquo;<br>
        For Commander Vimes, Head of Ankh-Morpork City Watch, life consists of troubling times, linked together by&#8230; well, more troubling times.<br>
        Right now, it&rsquo;s the latter. There&rsquo;s a werewolf with pre-lunar tension in the city, a dwarf with attitude and a golem who&rsquo;s begun to think for itself&#8230; and that&rsquo;s just the ordinary trouble. The real problem is more puzzling &ndash; people are being murdered, but there&rsquo;s no trace of anything alive having been at the crime scene.<br>
        Now Vimes not only has to find out whodunit, but howdunit too. He&rsquo;s not even sure what they dun. But soon as he knows what the questions are, he&rsquo;s going to want some answers.<br>

Of course, no one would dream of starting a war without a perfectly good reason&#8230; such as a &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; piece of old rock in the middle of nowhere.<br>

        A few days ago Sam Vimes was a copper &ndash; an important copper, true &ndash; chief of police &ndash; but still, at his core, a policeman. Today he is an ambassador &ndash; to the mysterious, fat-rich country of Uberwald. Today, Sam Vimes is also a man on the run.<br>

        Between them and Lancre stands a coven of four &ndash; Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat and young Agnes &ndash; and they don&rsquo;t take kindly to murderous intruders . . .<br>

        synopsis: `Rats! They&rsquo;re everywhere: in the breadbins, dancing across tabletops, stealing pies from under the cooks&rsquo; noses. So what does every town need? A good piper to lure them away.<br>
        That&rsquo;s where Maurice comes in. But he&rsquo;s only a cat (though one that talks), so although he has the ideas, he needs rats and someone to play the pipe. Who better than the kid to play the pipe? And Dangerous Beans. And Peaches. And Hamnpork (who doesn&rsquo;t really like what&rsquo;s been happening since The Change; all a rat leader really needs is to be big and stroppy, thinking is just not his thing). And Darktan. And Sardines. And all the others in the Clan.<br>
        Then they arrive in Bad Blintz, which is suffering from a plague of rats, and find there are NO rats anywhere (though the two resident rat catchers seem to have plenty of tails to show, at 50 pence per tail).<br>
        Someone else has had ideas, and Maurice is not pleased.`,
